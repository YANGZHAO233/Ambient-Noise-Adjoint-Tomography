INSTALLATION of Hybrid Specfem / axisem 


  1-- go to specfem3d (git devel version) and run configure script 

     ./configure FC=ifort MPIFC=mpif90 CC=icc 


  2-- Do one modification in 

         file ./src/meshfem3D/save_databases.F90 line 112
         logical, parameter :: SAVE_MESH_AS_CUBIT = .true.


  3-- Now compile the code for coupled mode : 

      in specfem3d devel directory 
 
           make all 


    **** NOTE when doing any modifications in files add_to*.*90 you must compile after doing a make clean

         make clean
	 make all 

    ****** you can use 'make realclean' to clean also scotch directory. 



  4-- compile tools for coupling Axisem/Specfem 

     go to ./EXTERNAL_CODES_coupled_with_SPECFEM3D/AxiSEM_for_SPECFEM3D/UTILS_COUPLING_SpecFEM 
     and type
 
            make all 

     **** NOTE the compilers are defined in config.h file here you must apdate to yours (by default it's intel)


  5-- installing the matlab gui 
      
       launch matlab in DSM_FOR_SPECFEM3D/inverse_problem/matlab_gui directory and run
        
         INSTALL_MATLAB_GUI_FOR_SPECFEM


  6-- install m_map tools for displaying maps in gui 

       go to /DSM_FOR_SPECFEM3D/inverse_problem/matlab_gui/m_map/m_map
       and set :

       PATHNAME=' **** your path to DSM_FOR_SPECFEM **** /inverse_problem/matlab_gui/m_map/m_map/';  

    *** NOTE this is the procedure needed by m_map  


  7-- using matlab gui : launch matlab and add the path to gui tools : 
          
          Hybrid_Axisem_Specfem
