This example illustrates two options for extending the bottom layer of the socal1D model. In some scenarios, it is helpful to extend the boundaries to eliminate spurious reflections from boundaries.

First run the default socal1D example with 1 core.
Then try examples A and B.

EXAMPLE A: Change bottom interface from -60 km to -200 km; use uniform element
           spacing in bottom layer.

 > cp Mesh_Par_file_deep ../Mesh_Par_file
 > cd interfaces_deep.dat ../interfaces.dat
 > cd ..
 > ./process.sh

EXAMPLE B: Change bottom interface from -60 km to -200 km; add -60 km as a
           new interface, such that the mesh above -60 km remains identical to
           the default model that extends to 60 km depth only.

 > cp Mesh_Par_file_deep_honor60km ../Mesh_Par_file
 > cp interfaces_deep_honor60km.dat ../interfaces.dat
 > cp interface0.dat ..
 > cd ..
 > ./process.sh

The models for A and B are identical, but the meshes are subtley different: as shown in honor60km_or_not.png, mesh A does not honor the 60 km interface, whereas mesh B does. Since there is no material contrast at 60 km depth, the synthetics are expected to be nearly identical.
