this test can be done on your workstation, as long as you have FOUR CPUs available.
it should be done within 15 minutes. 


to run this test, simply use (after ./configure FC=ifort MPIFC=mpif90):

./run_inhomogeneous.bash


you will be given information at the very end:

 DATASPACE=       ?
 MODELSPACE=      ?
 relative error=  ?

check "relative error", it must be small enough (~0.001 should be OK).
If you fail the test, PURE ELASTIC kernel calculation is problematic.
