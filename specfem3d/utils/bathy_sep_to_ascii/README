Tool to create a bathymetry ASCII file in specfem3d'topo format from a VS SEP model.
It just assumes that points with VS=0 are part of the water layer.

How to use it;
1) Generate the make file
$> cd specfem3d/utils/bathy_sep_to_ascii
$> cmake .

You may change the CMakeCache.txt file, although it is not mandatory as this tool
is not a critical computational step.

2) Compile
$> make

3) ./bin/create_ascii_bathy_from_sep_vs --help
