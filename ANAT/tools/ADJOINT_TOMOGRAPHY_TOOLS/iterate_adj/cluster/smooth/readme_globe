smooth_sem_globe:

  reads in GLOBAL mesh and kernels, in parallel on all processors, and
  smooths by a three-dimensional gaussian

0. compile executable 'smooth_sem': 
    (source files have been moved to SPECFEM3D_GLOBE package in src/tomography/)
    > cd ~/SPECFEM3D_GLOBE/
    > make xsmooth_sem
    then copy binary into this directory...


1. create symbolic link 'topo' to link to topography files:
    > ln -s ../topo
    (make sure ../topo links to files proc_**_save_data_1.bin and proc_**_save_data_2.bin)

2. create symbolic link directory 'OUTPUT_SUM/'
   which holds the summed kernel files proc**_alpha_kernel.bin, etc.as outputted by sum_kernel/ executable


  run with:
  ---------  
  > ./run_globe.bash

  (will run for about 2 hours...)

  which creates smoothed kernel partitions "_smooth.bin" in the same directory
  as the input ones.
  
  check size of smoothing in file go_globe_pbs.bash:
   
   - example: for periods 20s - 100s: minimum wavelength lambda ~ 4 km/s * 20 s = 80 km
              then smoothing sizes become   
                  horizontal = lambda
                  vertical    = lambda/4
